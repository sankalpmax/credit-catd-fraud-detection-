# credit-card-fraud-detection

Credit card fraud detection is a critical application of machine learning that aims to identify fraudulent transactions from genuine ones in real-time or batch processing scenarios. Python, being a popular programming language for data science and machine learning, is often used in conjunction with various machine learning libraries and techniques to build effective fraud detection models.

# tools used 
Python: Python serves as the primary programming language for building the fraud detection pipeline due to its versatility and extensive ecosystem of data science and machine learning libraries.

NumPy and Pandas: NumPy and Pandas are fundamental libraries for data manipulation and handling. They are used for preprocessing and organizing the credit card transaction data.

scikit-learn: Scikit-learn is a widely-used machine learning library in Python. It provides a range of algorithms for classification and anomaly detection, which are essential for credit card fraud detection.

TensorFlow and Keras: TensorFlow and Keras are deep learning frameworks that are used for building and training neural network models, which can be effective for detecting complex fraud patterns.

XGBoost and LightGBM: XGBoost and LightGBM are popular gradient boosting libraries known for their high performance in classification tasks, making them well-suited for fraud detection.

Matplotlib and Seaborn: These libraries are used for data visualization to gain insights into the data distribution and patterns, which can help in feature engineering and understanding the model's behavior.
